# My Portfolio
## Description and Motivation
This project will be my professional portfolio. I am doing this project to collect the information on my skills and contacts in one site. It will also be used to showcase my projects.
## Prior Art
Cole's (https://coleanderson7278.github.io) website inspired me to possibly split my work up across multiple pages, with each page corrispoding to an important topic (Biography, Projects, Contact). However, I want my navbar to scroll with the screen. There have been sites I have seen where content is staggered, like having pictures and text alternate sides. I thought that would look really clean.
## Core User Workflow
The site will be strictly informational. The landing page will be my autobiography, along with links to other pages on the site. These pages will store information on my projects and my contact information. Each page will allow you to navigate between them, with a navbar always at the top of the screen.

The landing page will include a picture of me, a paragraph about me, and a list of programming languages and tools I use. The Projects page will include brief descriptions of projects I have worked on, and links to their repositories and pages. These will include my first two Unit Projects, my Minecraft Clone, and Stardust Kingdoms.
## Tuesday-Thursday Goals
### *Tuesday*
I hope to get the basic navigation of the site done. This means that the user will be able to interact with a locked nav bar, and be taken to different pages on the site.
### *Wednesday*
I hope to fill in the content of the page, and add some CSS formatting. This means the user will be able view my autobiography, and have some level of formatting.
### *Thursday*
I hope to finish the site, with finishing the formatting, reviewing the content, and adding media queries, so that the site will be mobile friendly. This means that the user will be able to view the site on both mobile and desktop, with each platform having it's own formatting.
