      {My name is Matthew Wilson. I am a Software Developer, and currently a student at
        Base Camp Coding Academy. Game Development has been a long-time passion of mine.
        This drive of creating games has led me to software development where I enjoy
        solving problems with creative and innovative solutions. My short-term goal is to
        employ as a full-time software developer where I hope to be part of a team that has
        a similar drive and passion for development.}

        with C# as the scripting language. Set in Medieval Europe, this fantasy
        game revolves around the mystical Amulet of Light, a power treasure that
        allows the holder to control the cycle of night and day.}

        on this together, wanting to make a fun but simple virtual card game.
        The game uses Python to run.}

        {This was my second major project at Base Camp. Me and Andy Duarte
        worked on this together. We aimed to make a top-down game with features
        inspired by Call of Duty's iconic Zombies mode, and Left 4 Dead. The
        game uses Python and Pygame. The sound effects were recorded by me.}

        the legendary game Minecraft, this game features building, mining,
        muliple blocks, and the ability to save your current world. This game is
        also made with Python and Pygame.}
