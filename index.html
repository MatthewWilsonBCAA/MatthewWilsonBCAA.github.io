        My name is Matthew Wilson. I am a Software Developer, and currently a student at
        Base Camp Coding Academy. Game Development has been a long-time passion of mine.
        This drive of creating games has led me to software development where I enjoy
        solving problems with creative and innovative solutions. My short-term goal is to
        employ as a full-time software developer where I hope to be part of a team that has
        a similar drive and passion for development.

        This is my personal project. The project uses Unity 3D Game Engine,
        with C# as the scripting language. Set in Medieval Europe, this fantasy
        game revolves around the mystical Amulet of Light, a power treasure that
        allows the holder to control the cycle of night and day.

        This was my first major project at Base Camp. Me and Lathe Ward worked
        on this together, wanting to make a fun but simple virtual card game.
        The game uses Python to run.

        This was my second major project at Base Camp. Me and Andy Duarte
        worked on this together. We aimed to make a top-down game with features
        inspired by Call of Duty's iconic Zombies mode, and Left 4 Dead. The
        game uses Python and Pygame. The sound effects were recorded by me.

        This is a major side project that I worked on at Base Camp. Inspired by
        the legendary game Minecraft, this game features building, mining,
        muliple blocks, and the ability to save your current world. This game is
        also made with Python and Pygame.
